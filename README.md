# Intrusion Detection

This task for this project was to build a network intrusion detector,a predictive model capable of classifying incoming connections as good or 'normal' connections and bad or 'intrusions'.The dataset was provided as two independent sets of training and testing data.


A basic Flask API was also created to put this system in production.
